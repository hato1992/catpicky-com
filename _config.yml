<h1>Most Common Types Of Cat Litter Boxes And Recommendations - Catpicky</h1>

<p>Have you ever had a hard time choosing the right litter box for your cat? When we’re still a novice to pet care and picking toilets for our small bosses, we had no idea which one we should go for! There are too many types of cat litter boxes out there:the litter pan, the cat’s house, the dome box, etc. So exactly, how can we choose the right one for both our kitties and us? “It may be difficult to find the perfect litter box, so we looked at dozens of litter boxes and litter pans to find the best, highest quality and most durable litter box based on price, designs and whether they were self-cleaning.” April R. Natal, Authority & Blogger of Catpicky <a href="https://catpicky.com/">https://catpicky.com</a></p>

<p>Type of Cat Litter Boxes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open litter pans</li>
<li>Hooded litter boxes</li>
<li>Top-entry litter boxes</li>
<li>Self-cleaning litter boxes</li>
<li>Disposable litter boxes</li>
<li>Travel litter boxes</li>
<li>Types of Cat Litter Boxes</li>
<ol>
<p>It depends on many factors that you decide how to classify different types of litter boxes. For instance, we have multiple cats litter boxes, which serve more than one cat in the house, or foldable pop-up travel litter boxes for your cats’ outside trip. In general, we divide those litter boxes into two big categories is the open type, and the enclosed type:</p>
<p>Open litter boxes are the ones without a roof there are a lot smaller litter boxes’ designs in this bucket, such as the foldable boxes or disposable litter tray.</p>
E<p>Endclosed litter boxes are covered - this type is commonly known in two main designs, the dome/hidden/front-entry or top-entry boxes.</p>

<p>These two types are mainly different in their size and odors-control ability. For more information on the benefits of each type, take a look at our next section:</p>

<h3>IRIS Top Entry Cat Litter Box with Cat Litter Scoop - Best Top-Entry Litter Box</h3>

<p>Any other choice for a tidy cat bathroom rather than an enclosed dome box? Well, you can always choose top-entry cat litter boxes! They do not only look so smart and compact but also provide cats and owners with a lot of benefits. First, as their name suggests, top-entry litter boxes have a unique design with their doors on top of the boxes. This results in cleaner areas around litter boxes since the cats already wipe their paws before jumping onto the floor! Also, because the door is on the upper side, litter, fresh or used, can not get out of the box. That’s why you can have as much litter inside as you want, which leads to minimum litter cleaning and replacing! Besides, this IRIS’s litter box has a super space-conservative built thanks to its vertical stand and mat-free design. This piece is not a self-cleaning cat litter box, but there is a litter scooper in the shipping pack for quick cleaning!</p>

<li>Roomy for more litter in the box</li>
<li>Space-saving design</li>
</ul>

<p>Under which circumstance do you usually use a disposable litter box? For us, we often use it while traveling or when we are too busy to dispose of the used litter and clean the box. In this case, an environmentally-friendly disposable choice will leave us with a clean, sanitary litter box with no effort! However, our friends say that they prefer to use these as the padding inside their cats’ bathroom. For example, this Nature’s Miracle features baking soda in its ingredients to give us extra cover on smelly ammonia odors. The other ingredient of it is recycled paper, which made this piece super friendly to the Earth and also land-fill safe! </p>
